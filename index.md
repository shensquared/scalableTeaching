👋 Hi there! This site is intended as an "underground guide" on the teaching and running an MIT EECS course (particularly the logistical side of it).

Some quick notes:
- This guide is unofficial -- based on my personal experience and big thanks to the [folks'](./credits) collective wisdom. 
- This guide focuses on EECS courses, but a lot of it does apply MIT wide.
- This guide is hopefully helpful for big classes; some parts may be useful more broadly though.

This site currently has these features:
- 👆 Built-in search box on top
- Annotation and highlighting (click me :)
- Click-to-copy code snippets
- 👇 Quick edit via the footnote link (feature requests and bug reports super welcome)
