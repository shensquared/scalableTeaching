ğŸ‘‹ Hi there! This site is intended as an "underground guide" on the teaching and running an MIT EECS course (particularly the logistical side of it).

{: .warning}
> Some quick notes:
>- This guide is unofficial -- based on my personal experience and big thanks to the [folks'](./credits). 
>- This guide focuses on EECS courses, but a lot of it does apply MIT wide.
>- This guide is hopefully helpful for big classes; some parts may be useful more broadly though.
>- Right now contents are sparse... and rough... ğŸ«£


This site currently has these features:
- ğŸ‘† Site-wide search box on top
- Annotation and highlighting (click me :)
- Click-to-copy code snippets
- ğŸ‘‡ Quick edit via the footnote link (feature requests and bug reports super welcome)
