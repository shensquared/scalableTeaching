### Student Support Services - S^3

For undergrad students, if you are dealing with a personal or medical issue that is impacting your ability to attend class, complete work, or take an exam, you should contact a dean in Student Support Services (S3). S3 is here to help you. The deans will verify your situation, provide you with support, and help you work with your professor or instructor to determine next steps. 

In most circumstances, you will not be excused from coursework without verification from a dean. Please visit the [S3 website](https://studentlife.mit.edu/s3) for contact information and more ways that they can provide support.


### Disability and Access Services - DAS

We are committed to the principle of equal access, and we are more
than willing to make arrangements to help accommodate students with
disabilities or related challenges. In general, knowing about the kind
of help you need earlier in the semester means that we'll be better
prepared to provide that help effectively, in coordination
with Disability and Access Services.

If you have a disability and are not planning to use accommodations,
it is still recommended that you meet with DAS staff to familiarize
yourself with their services and resources. If you have been approved
for accommodations by DAS, 6.790 staff are ready to assist with
implementation. 

Please send these approved requests to inform us, and we will work to implement these accommodations.


### Office of Graduate Education (OGE)

For graduate students, a variety of issues may impact your academic career including faculty/student relationships, funding, and interpersonal concerns. In the Office of Graduate Education (OGE), GradSupport provides consultation, coaching, and advocacy to graduate students on matters related to academic and life challenges. If you are dealing with an issue that is impacting your ability to attend class, complete work, or take an exam, you may contact GradSupport by email at <a href="mailto:gradsupport@mit.edu">gradsupport@mit.edu</a>
or via phone at (617) 253-4860. More info can be found at [GradSupport](https://oge.mit.edu/development/gradsupport/).
