# Point of contact

## At EECS
### The Education Officers (EOs)
- Dennis Freeman, Education Officer for EECS

- Elfar Adalsteinsson, Education Officer for Electrical Engineering (EE)

- Robert C. Miller, Education Officer for Computer Science (CS)

- Yury Polyanskiy, Education Officer for Artificial Intelligence and Decision Making (AI+D)

### Lisa Bella

- processes TA appointment 

- should be contacted for all classroom booking:

    There are basically two types of classrooms for us. first, there's the Registrar-"owned" rooms, and the Registrar will only confirm your booking if it comes from Lisa. Second, there's the department-"owned" rooms, e.g., those tutorial rooms in building 24 and a few "special" rooms in building 34; booking of these rooms are immediately and directly confirmed by Lisa.

- is the department liaison with all matters involving the Registrar:

    What this means is that, for a lot of things that you'd try to ask the Registrar for, for an EECS subject -- system access, course records, etc. -- you may be able to short-circuit and get them from Lisa.

### The EECS Undergrad Office

The [UG](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/academics/undergraduate-programs/resources-for-current-students/) is the same office that administers e.g. course-6 undergad registration, degree-requirement petition; their juristication extends to the MEng program too.

In terms of specific course-related matters, the UG might only be reaching out directly to the course staff regarding:

- Mid-term flagging
- IAP course proposal; including graduate-level IAP course proposal. (As an aside, Spring/Fall new course proposal should go directly to the EOs)
- Past-term OX (if this student is in the graduating class)
- Special reqeust and/or accommodations (these more typically would come from the S3 and/or DAS; but there are rare situations where UG would need to get invovled too).

### Student Support Services (S3)

For undergrad students, if you are dealing with a personal or medical issue that is impacting your ability to attend class, complete work, or take an exam, you should contact a dean in Student Support Services (S3). S3 is here to help you. The deans will verify your situation, provide you with support, and help you work with your professor or instructor to determine next steps. 

In most circumstances, you will not be excused from coursework without verification from a dean. Please visit the [S3 website](https://studentlife.mit.edu/s3) for contact information and more ways that they can provide support.


### Disability and Access Services (DAS)

We are committed to the principle of equal access, and we are more
than willing to make arrangements to help accommodate students with
disabilities or related challenges. In general, knowing about the kind
of help you need earlier in the semester means that we'll be better
prepared to provide that help effectively, in coordination
with Disability and Access Services.

If you have a disability and are not planning to use accommodations,
it is still recommended that you meet with DAS staff to familiarize
yourself with their services and resources. If you have been approved
for accommodations by DAS, 6.790 staff are ready to assist with
implementation. 

Please send these approved requests to inform us, and we will work to implement these accommodations.


### Office of Graduate Education (OGE)

For graduate students, a variety of issues may impact your academic career including faculty/student relationships, funding, and interpersonal concerns. In the Office of Graduate Education (OGE), GradSupport provides consultation, coaching, and advocacy to graduate students on matters related to academic and life challenges. If you are dealing with an issue that is impacting your ability to attend class, complete work, or take an exam, you may contact GradSupport by email at <a href="mailto:gradsupport@mit.edu">gradsupport@mit.edu</a>
or via phone at (617) 253-4860. More info can be found at [GradSupport](https://oge.mit.edu/development/gradsupport/).
