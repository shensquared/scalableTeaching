A collection of widgets and small apps to make administrivia fun and efficient!

## Scheduling stuff
### On-demand OHs booking

I host this on-demand OHs [booking](https://cal.shenshen.mit.edu/shensquared/gradml-ohs) tool. It is intended to complement fix-scheduled OHs.

The tool is publicly accessible and offers "seats", which can be helpful if a student wants to tag along and join in others' booking. Also, I host the server in my office and all data is encrypted. Feel free to register an account.
### Academic Calendar Template

I maintain a [Course Calendar Template](https://shenshen.mit.edu/git/shensquared/teachingcalendar) where I pull key dates from the Registrar. This "pulling" is intentionally manual; the dates are then programmatically cross-checked against the `.ics` release from the Registrar.

### w2m (private and prettier When2Meet alternative)

## Machine-learning courses tree


This [Machine Learning Courses Tree](https://shenshen.mit.edu/tree/) is mainly geared towards AI+D folks, but perhaps helpful too if your academic advisees ask about the tips on picking the various ML courses on campus.



## Bonus (cheesy but fun) ideas

### Design a course logo

Adam Hartz designed a course logo for 6.101. I thought it was a very cute and fun idea and copied it for 6.390. 

I'd need to check with Adam on how he made his logo. For mine I drew everything on iPad using the app `Procreate`.
### MAKE a course logo

It's even more fun to bring the digital logo to the real world! Some resources towards that:

- Various Maker-Space on campus
- [Sticker Mule](https://www.stickermule.com) for various swag (stickers, magnets, pin, etc). They do painless tax-exemption process.
