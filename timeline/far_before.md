# Far Ahead of the Semester-Start
Most of the interactions and "communications" happens on [eduportal](https://eecseduportal.mit.edu/eduportal/lects/).

## TA hiring
The department runs centralized TA matching/hiring. 

### Timeline
- For upcoming Spring semesters, TA-preference deadline typically fall somewhere mid-October. 
- For upcoming Fall semesters, TA-preference deadline typically fall somewhere mid-March. 
- Instructors are to indicate "preferences" (and only preferences.)
- A matching algorithm takes into consideration the preferences from both the courses and the candidates, and the algorithm spits out pairing recommendations.
- The EOs make hiring offers on behalf of the department.

### Tips
- 1 GradTA slot = 4 Undergraduate TA slots
- Grad TAs are expected to work at the maximum of 20hours per week
- Undergraduate TA are expected to work at the maximum of 10hours per week

## LA/grader hiring
Unlike TA hiring, LA and grader hires are typically done by individual courses. The detailed procedure can be found also on Eduportal, under this [tab](https://eecseduportal.mit.edu/eduportal/lects/#my-assigned-classes--la-graders)
### Timeline 
LA and grader hiring can happen a lot later than TA hiring and there's no set deadlines. 

### Tips
- A couple of big undergraduate courses have been hiring LAs in a centralized manner, via [eecsla](https://eecsla.mit.edu/) site. If you're interested in joining the fun, feel free to reach out to Adam Hartz or Rob Miller.
- More info about e.g. the pay of such [Hourly Employment](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/resources/student-hourly-employment/)
- LAs and Graders are to submit time sheets. These are to be approved by the department Financial office (led by Irene Yong Rong Huang).
