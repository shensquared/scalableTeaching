### Changing a letter grade
It's possible to change a letter grade after submission onto OGS. This is done via submitting a special report on OGS (a good-to-know fact but hopefully you never need to use this -- it's possible to submit one single report for a batch of corrections, if you'd like to do everything in on-go). 

The report(s) then goes to the department head (Asu) for approval before taking effect.
